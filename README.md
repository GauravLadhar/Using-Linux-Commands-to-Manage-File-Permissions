# Using Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions

Given the following scenario:

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 


Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.


Using Linux commands in the Bash shell, I modified and applied permissions based on organizational requirements.
